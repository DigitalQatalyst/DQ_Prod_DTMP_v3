2. THIS MARKETPLACE: KNOWLEDGE CENTER
What is Knowledge Center?
Knowledge Center is the central repository of transformation knowledge, documentation, and best practices for the organization. It serves as the collective wisdom accumulated from transformation initiatives, industry research, and organizational experience.
Core Function: Provide searchable, categorized access to articles, guides, case studies, reference materials, FAQs, lessons learned, and best practices that help users navigate their digital transformation journey.
Why Does This Marketplace Exist?
Problem Being Solved:
Organizations typically struggle with:
•	❌ Knowledge scattered - Documentation spread across wikis, SharePoint, email, personal drives
•	❌ Tribal knowledge - Critical information exists only in people's heads
•	❌ Reinventing the wheel - Teams solve problems that others have already solved
•	❌ Lost lessons learned - Insights from past projects are not captured or shared
•	❌ No single source - Users don't know where to find transformation guidance
•	❌ Outdated content - No clear ownership or review process for documentation
•	❌ Low discoverability - Good content exists but can't be found when needed
Solution:
Knowledge Center provides:
•	✅ Centralized repository - Single place for all transformation knowledge
•	✅ Curated content - Transformation Office reviews and maintains quality
•	✅ Searchable library - Find answers quickly with search and filters
•	✅ Categorized by topic - Browse by transformation phase, domain, or content type
•	✅ Living documentation - Regularly updated with new learnings
•	✅ Best practices - Proven approaches from successful initiatives
•	✅ Self-service - Users find answers without asking for help
•	✅ Contribution model - Teams can share their knowledge back
Knowledge Center vs. Learning Center
These are different marketplaces serving different needs:
Dimension	Knowledge Center	Learning Center
Purpose	Reference & documentation	Structured education
Content Type	Articles, guides, wikis	Courses, certifications
Format	Read-at-your-own-pace	Structured lessons + assessments
Learning Model	Just-in-time, need-based	Comprehensive, sequential
Completion	No completion tracking	Progress tracking, certificates
Use Case	"How do I solve X?"	"Teach me about Y"
Example	"API Gateway Design Guide"	"API Design Course (8 hours)"
Analogy	Stack Overflow, Wikipedia	Udemy, Coursera
When to use Knowledge Center:
•	"I need to quickly reference the API naming conventions"
•	"What's the best practice for data migration?"
•	"Has anyone solved this integration problem before?"
When to use Learning Center:
•	"I want to learn cloud architecture fundamentals"
•	"I need certification in SAFe methodology"
•	"Train my team on microservices patterns"
Relationship to Other Marketplaces
Knowledge Center supports other marketplaces with documentation:

5. **Results Count & Active Filters**
```
   Showing 23 articles
   
   Active filters: [Design ×] [Architecture & Design ×] [Clear all]
```

**RBAC Considerations:**

Unlike Portfolio Management, **all users see all published articles** in Knowledge Center. There's no role-based filtering of content visibility.

**Reasoning:**
- Knowledge should be openly accessible
- Promotes knowledge sharing culture
- Reduces duplication of effort
- Encourages collaboration

**Exception:** Draft articles (unpublished) are only visible to:
- The author
- Transformation Office (reviewers)

### **Column 3: Article Reader**

**Purpose:** Display selected article with full content, navigation, and actions

**Layout:**
